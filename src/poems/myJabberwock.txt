MY JABBERWOCK

The beast rages inside me, until we beat it back into its cage
It lies there, locked in submission, quietly building up its rage
Until it reappears and wrecks my remission,
And the battle begins again.

You don’t die; your goal is to kill me.
But I will fight you with all I have:
Eastern & Western medicine, improved nutrition & exercise;
For this also sends you back into your cage,
Snarling, sniveling at me the whole time,
While I again live my ‘new normal’ life just fine.

I have come to accept our symbiotic relationship.
While I despise your presence, I love the other
Warriors I have met, who also beat your relatives back
Into their own respective cages as well,
Until you break out again, raising hell.
For hell is where you belong, you despicable disease.

When I am at long last in heaven I will finally be free.
Yet I will not do anything to hasten my journey there,
Preferring to wage the war as best I can here.
While you drag me down at times, I also thrive in so many ways
I never would have done before you first bit me.
You are trapped; I am trapped. Yet, I also am FREE…

Freer than you will ever be!
For you will cease someday, yet I will continue on,
Which makes me the victor, not you, you disgusting Satan’s spawn.
