The Me I was before you robbed me wasn't always very nice 
I was healthy, I thought, but never fully understood the price 
Of good health, of good friends, of good family and such 
When you took away my health, I really gained very much 
Appreciation of life anew; 
Of family, of friends, and many things large and few. 

You may have robbed me of part of my breast, bones, and now all my hair; 
But I never have felt so alive and very much aware 
Of all the things I am grateful for and can somewhat crazily say 
Thank you for the appreciation I now have for every day! 

I thought I was nice and positive before when the truth really was 
I worried about so many things that didn't matter because 
I didnï¿½t realize how special each little thing can be
Until you robbed me, but awakened me to Me. 

This crazy rhyme may seem to some to not make very much sense; 
The meter's uneven and I often change my tense(s!) 
But that's OK because I'm reminded to thank God for each moment I'm alive 
And grateful for another day in which I have to thrive! 

So ironically: thank you, you stupid, stupid thief! 
(And thank you God for helping me through it all!)
