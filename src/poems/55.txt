55 and I am still alive 
How did this come to be? 
Modern medicine, Grace of God 
and prayers of the people... All three! 

10 years ago I was told I would likely not see this day 
And if I did, it may be with great dismay 
At the condition I would be in 
Due to cancer raging within. 

A year ago at this time survival was uncertain 
I had so much cancer... and so much hurting. 

Sure now I have a stent to help me pee 
And just took a pill to help me poop 

I see the oncologist to get some special soup 
Poured into the port that sits near my heart 
Oh what a weekly hoot! 

I don't have quite enough meniscus in one knee 
But grandkids I dearly love... All three! 
Along with my daughters... All three! 

Neuropathy, kidney hydronephrosis and thyroid disorder... 
It's a trade I will make in exchange for life 
I still have a lot of quality 
For a life that wasn't supposed to be 
This long or this good. 

I am so thankful for the clinical trial 
As it lets me continue many extra miles 
To continue dragon boating 
And using good medicine... I am really promoting!
