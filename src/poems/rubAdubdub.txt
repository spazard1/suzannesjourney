Rub a Dub Dub

Rub a dub dub 
Chemo patient in the tub 
Trying to relax 
And soak off the past 
day's grime, sweat and faltering hair 
As some tumbles out unaware 
This metamorphosis can be hard 
As we shed part of the skin we are in. 

Rub a dub dub 
Don't relax too much 
Or that Ativan you took 
Will have you saying Glub glub 
As you sink and slither deeper into the tub! 

Rub a dub dub. 

Rub a dub dub. 
A grandma in the tub 
As her eyes glance across the many toys 
Reminding her of grandgirls and grandboy 
Who also come to rub a dub dub 
In this very garden tub. 

I smile as I soak and recall 
Olivia playing with all of these fun tub toys 
For both girls and boys. 
Dress-up dollies pressed flat against the tub wall 
As cut out toy fishes go splat against the wall as well. 

Rub a dub dub... 
Benji swirling water round and round 
As toy fishes and ocean creatures give chase 
To his crazy lil fun made up tub race. 

Rub a dub dub 
Still waiting for Sasha to play in our tub 
We have lots of yellow duckies awaiting her trip. 

Rub a dub dub 
The chemo patient in the tub 
Remembers she is a grandma too 
With still much enjoyment and living to do. 

As she relaxes in her tub eyes glancing fondly 
At the dolphin and duckie puppet washcloths hanging from the wall 
With baby washcloths and other toys just waiting to GROW 
as soon as a child puts it in the tub and makes it so. 

Rub a dub dub 
This grandma with a grin 
Feels refreshed as she gets up to dress 
And eagerly await the day 
these toys come alive again to play. 

Rub a dub dub 
The next grandkid visits in two months 
Rub a dub 
Can't wait to give him a hug! 

Rub a dub dub... 
Rub a dub dub.. 
Rub a dub.
