Every Instinct Told Me 
Tuesday, Nov 3, 2020 

Every Instinct told me to turn and run. 
But I wanted to stay and have some fun! 

Fun as I laughed and played, 
Even floated with glee. 
Come, oh, come and play with me! 

Ignore the instinct and tell it to hush! (Hoosh) 
While we play hard behind this bush 

And run from tree to tree. 
Forget what Every Instinct Told Me. 

What has Every Instinct told you? 
To "Give up" and that you are "through?" 

Well I will listen to no such thing. 
For no joy does to me it bring! 

I urge you, no implore you, to do the same 
What does it matter if you are lame?  

For fun you can still have if only you see 
You ignore Every Instinct and come play with me! 

Normally I say, "Go with your gut." 
But today I feel like "So what?" 

So what if Every Instinct told us to behave? 
What if instead we wanted to rave 

Over beautiful things 
Dangerous things 
Wild, scary, yet very right things.

Yet why did we have to endure much chiding 
After Every Instinct found us hiding? 

Hiding from its truth and wisdom 
While we also had some fun 

Well, no guilt do I feel as we 
kept it real - ha! Really fun! 

Sing, run, jump, and laugh! 
Overall we just had a blast! 

In the end we must listen to Every Instinct 
Even if it thinks we acted indecent. 

I will succumb to it in the end. 
I just needed to enjoy my friend 
One more time until I am sent    
To a place I will go when mind and body are spent

But my spirit? You will never dominate me. 
That part, Every Instinct, will always remain... free! 


PS: This sounds more hedonistic than was my intent. 
It's meant about enjoying life before it is spent.
