"Come look, come see! 
We have lots of baby guppies!" 

As my three little girls 
with their hair all in curls 
kneel in awe one Sunday morning, 
in front of our big aquarium 
with new baby guppies staring at them, 

I, too, feel compelled to kneel, 
in awe of the wonder of God's creation: 
of fish and girls 
with their hair all in curls. 

"How beautiful!" I say inside with elation, 
as I stare at my girls 
with their hair all in curls, 
as they gaze with big, beautiful eyes 
at the guppies - which are just tails with eyes - 
who in turn stare back at the girls 
with their hair all in curls, 
as all of us are taken aback by the 
beauty and mystery of God's creation.
