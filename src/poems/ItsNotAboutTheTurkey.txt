It's not about the turkey 
or the sweet potatoes 
Pies or gravy 
The creamed corn
special rolls 
and cranberry sauce. 
For without the people 
it's all lost. 

I can't let the turkey surpass the Thanksgiving. 
For I am so grateful to still be living! 

Last Black Friday on a wintery day 
I stood over two cemetery plots 
Where my husband and I will some day lay. 
I wrote the check and it's off my to do list. 
There is too much to enjoy before I am missed! 

While I got worse after that I soon got better 
thanks to a brand new clinical trial. 
I am still in treatment and have some side effects 
But hopefully I have a lot longer now before my body is laid to rest. 

I have seen so much family in this past year 
and dragon boated with much cheer.
Got to hold and love grandchild #3 
and thank God for his constant grace to me. 

So not to offend you but I hope you understand 
Why I don't say Happy Turkey Day across our land. 
For it has little to do with the turkey or other food 
But more about the people, family and the good 
things we enjoy and can accomplish together 
and remember to thank God for the storms he helps us weather. 

Happy Thanksgiving 2017!
