THE WOMAN IN THE MIRROR

THE WOMAN IN THE MIRROR...
WHO IS SHE?
SHE IS YOUNG, SHE IS VIBRANT
SHE IS HEALTHY, SHE IS LOVING
SHE IS MARRIED, SHE BECOMES A MOTHER
SHE IS A HARD WORKER, SHE IS A LOVER.
THE WOMAN IN THE MIRROR...
WHO IS SHE?
SHE IS SICK, SHE GETS BETTER.
SHE GETS SICK AGAIN, SHE FIGHTS HARDER.
SHE IS BALD, SHE HAS SURGERY
SHE TAKES MEDS EVERYDAY NOW.
THE WOMAN IN THE MIRROR...
WHO IS SHE?
SHE IS NAUSEOUS, SHE GAINS WEIGHT.
SHE WEARS MANY SCARVES AND HATS.
SHE IS GRAY HAIRED, SHE IS TIRED.
SHE IS SICK LOOKING; SHE HAS AGED.
THE WOMAN IN THE MIRROR...
WHO IS SHE?
SHE IS A CHRISTIAN, SHE KEEPS THE FAITH.
SHE NEVER GIVES UP. SHE IS STILL STRONG.
SHE BECOMES A DRAGON BOAT PADDLER.
SHE IS THRIVING AGAIN.
THE WOMAN IN THE MIRROR...
WHO IS SHE?
SHE=S A GRANDMA, SHE LOVES HER FAMILY
SHE=S A HARD WORKER, DESPITE CHEMO BRAIN!
SHE IS SMART, SHE IS INTELLIGENT
SHE IS FUNNY, AND SARCASTIC!
THE WOMAN IN THE MIRROR...
WHO IS SHE?
SHE DYES HER HAIR, TIRED OF THE GRAY
SHE DRESSES NICER, WORKS OUT MORE
SHE DOES HER MAKEUP,
ENHANCING HER BETTER FEATURES
THE WOMAN IN THE MIRROR...
WHO IS SHE?
SHE LOOKS AT HERSELF
SHE RECOGNIZES HERSELF ONCE AGAIN.
SHE IS STILL SICK, BUT SHE IS HAPPY.
SHE IS WEAK, YET SHE IS STILL STRONG
THE WOMAN IN THE MIRROR...
WHO IS SHE?
SHE IS BEATING THE ODDS, SHE'S A FIGHTER.
SHE IS A SURVIVOR; SHE IS A THRIVER!
THAT WOMAN IN THE MIRROR...
WHO IS SHE? SHE IS ME!
