Cancer is a Chameleon 

Sunday, August 19, 2018 

Like the mini ancient dinosaur that changes its color 
Cancer follows me like no other 

Waiting as I change to a different medicine 
It pops in the background and subtly blends 
In with my skin and bones and tissues and glands 
Acting as if it belongs but I can hardly stand 
To feel it blending again behind the scenes 
Before new tumors are big enough for imaging to see 

Oh, chameleon go away! 
Don't wait for the color of my medicine to be gone 
So you can sneak in and play 
Around with my cells again and warp them some more 
God please grant me relief again, I do implore! 

Cancer first greeted me in 2006 
We caught it early and I thought I was fixed 
But 2 years later it got stronger 
Hitting me with stage 4... 
Future stages? There are no more. 


Despite odds I survived 8 years with estrogen/progesterone positive cancer 
Changing treatments with every recurrence 
Until cancer decided to morph to a stronger type to bring me down 
Now I have survived over 2 years with advanced triple negative breast cancer 
Defying more odds. 

Despite cancer's attempt to kill me 
And the dismay of well meaning people that I am not "healed" 
The miracle is really that despite this heinous disease 
I now have survived 10 years… I would like 10 or 20 more if You please! 

I will endure whatever I must 
As the scenery changes and Cancer's old color is revealed 
While I get new meds that will give me some more time to deal 
With life: family, friends and dragon boating 


For I am not done yet just in a bit of a slump 
While I have increased pain in my rump! 

Cancer loves my sacrum and pelvic area 
But we will blast it again. 
It may have more in store for me... 
But we have more in store for it than it does for me!! 

God, take my hand and help me be free!
