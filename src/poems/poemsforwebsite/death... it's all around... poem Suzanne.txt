Death... It's All Around...
November 2016 

Death, death, death...
It's all around.
Another person passed
And will soon be in the ground.

We were at a Christmas party last year
And now she is no longer here
Cherish ALL the time you have
Before its gone and all are sad.

Last week my cousin and now a friend,
When, oh God, is my end?
It's not for us to know yet
I'll try to live so there is no regret

Of so many things left undone
My family no longer one
Unified group as it should be
Let's fix it while I still have time to see:

Everyone forgiving and getting along,
Holidays are coming, let's break out in song!

After everyone has eaten a lot,
I'm picking out my cemetery plot!
It's all paid for, and I believe it's worth
Seeing where my remains will lie under the earth.

My preplanning will be nearly done
And then I plan to keep having fun!
Dragonboating while I can,
And doing whatever my medicine man
Tells me to do to keep fighting this beast
So with my family I can feast...

At another Thanksgiving followed by Christmas,
And whatever else God lets me enjoy on my list.

Thank you God for your continued grace to me
So I can keep enjoying my family.
I know sometime I will be on the other side,
But right now I'm grateful to still be alive!
