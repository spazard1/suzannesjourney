ANNIVERSARY

(on the loss of an unborn child, due on our 10th wedding anniversary, 01/02/93) 

Someday, my baby, you will come to me, 
then I will have you for all eternity. 
For in the millennium, you I’ll finally see… 
Oh what a wonderful anniversary. 

I feel that I’ve lost you, but I guess that’s not really true; 
for God is taking care of you now, 
much better than I could do. 
Oh, how I miss you; is it possible you miss me? 
What will you look like, when your face I see? 

Someday, my baby, you will come to me, 
then I will have you for all eternity. 
For in the millennium, you I’ll finally see… 
Oh, what a wonderful anniversary. 

We celebrate so many things people don’t want to forget: 
Like birthdays and holidays, wedding anniversaries, and yet… 
A “birth” day that would have been, some say I should forget. 
But I will always remember you, even though we’ve not yet met! 

Someday, my baby, you will come to me, 
then I will have you for all eternity. 
For in the millennium, you I’ll finally see… 
Oh, what a wonderful anniversary. 

Some people think before birth that your life has no worth. 
Yet I’ll always remember that day 
that would have been the anniversary of your birth… 
It will always be very special to me, 
For it was on your parents’ 10th wedding anniversary! 

Someday, my baby, you will come to me, 
then I will have you for all eternity. 
For in the millennium, you I’ll finally see… 
Oh, what a wonderful anniversary. 

Someday… someday… ANNIVERSARY!
