Today is worse than some.
Spending part of it on my bum
Getting up to do a chore
Like wash the dishes and sweep the floor

Nervous as one leg is swelling
Feels like there is no telling
How long to wait until it's better
One week, a month; can't wait forever.

Not the first time on this road or I would freak out more
As I wait for the hospital to schedule me so we can explore
Why this darn uretic stent stopped working
Go up in there and give it some twerking!

Time to change it and see if that helps
For pretty soon I shall start to yelp
A bit weary of the increased pain
I don't want to feel quite this lame!

Cancer tumors are crowding my innards
Somehow I think I will still be the winner
As I languish a little longer while
Hoping to get into this clinical trial.

Oh God let the new drugs attack these tumors
And Confirm all of the medical rumors
Of their healing qualities and new remedy
To finally kick cancer right out of me!
