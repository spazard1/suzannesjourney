Falling, falling
The leaves outside are falling.
Falling, falling
As I lay here bawling...

Wondering if I will see another fall
Wondering if this is really all...
All that's left for me to experience
All before I become delirious.

Chemo, what are you doing to me?
You're not supposed to be the enemy
But you're taking away my liberty
Now I am not what I used to be.

Falling, falling
The leaves outside are falling...

I've always loved this time of year
But now I have unsettled fear
Why am I in such distress?
I'm just making myself a bigger mess!

Falling, falling
The leaves outside are falling...

Oh, my Lord do I hear you calling
Please help me with my current longing
To still be helpful and have some worth
No matter how long I remain on earth.

The sun is shining through the trees
May the Son always shine through me
Despite my disability
I can do all through Him who strengthens me!

Falling, falling
The leaves outside are falling.
The birds are singing in the trees
And I am praying on my knees,

Thanking you for this earth
And all that has so much worth
Including yes, even me
Help me always to see

As long as I'm alive
There's a reason to thrive
Perhaps not physically
But more spiritually.

Help me to emotionally
Tangled webs no longer weave,
But in You always believe
By my side you'll never leave!

Falling, falling
The leaves outside are falling.
Somewhere still I hear my Savior calling
Now I can quit my bawling!

He brings comfort to my aching head
As I lay upon this nice bed
Saying "Child, I will bring you rest.
Keep on doing all your best...

To be kind to all you see,
Be gracious because of Me.
Try to always live in peace
It will bring you sweet release."

Falling, falling
The leaves outside are falling.
Although nothing physically changed,
However I do feel less deranged.

Any time spent in prayer
Helps to ease my cares
Thank you Lord for helping me
Inside my head to be free!

Falling, falling
The leaves outside are falling
And my Lord to me is calling...
